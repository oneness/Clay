# Clay

Clay is intented to be an open source web tools for URL processing from simple conversion such as
URL->PDF to URL analytics platform. Version 0.1.0 is just url to pdf converter and can
be easily extended to do other trivial stuff like extracting texts or images or anything from a given url.
I am throwing it out there so people interested can add or extended with usefull URL processing tools. My
hope is that maybe we can make this into a swiss army knife for URL mining.
